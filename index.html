	<p>Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] (listen); born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the sport,[4] he plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. Kohli holds numerous records in his career which includes scoring most runs in T20 internationals and IPL, fastest to reach 10,000 ODI runs. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has also contributed to India's successes, including winning the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy. He is among the only four Indian cricketers who has played 500 matches for India.[5]

Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at the West Delhi Cricket Academy and started his youth career with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut in 2008 and quickly became a key player in the ODI team and later made his Test debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time. During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs scored in the tournament. In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone, becoming the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. His form continued in 2019, when he became the first player to score 20,000 international runs in a single decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step down as the captain of the Indian national team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped down as the captain of the Test team as well.

He has received many accolades for his performances on the cricket field. He was recognized as the ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2012 and has won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Subsequently, Kohli also won ICC Test Player of the Year and ICC ODI Player of the Year awards in 2018, becoming the first player to win both awards in the same year. Additionally, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri under the sports category in 2017 and the Khel Ratna award, India's highest sporting honour, in 2018.

In 2016, he was ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN, and one of the most valuable athlete brands by Forbes. In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2020, he was ranked 66th in Forbes list of the top 100 highest-paid athletes in the world for the year 2020 with estimated earnings of over $26 million. Kohli has been deemed one of the most commercially viable cricketers, with estimated earnings of ₹165 crore (US$21 million) in the year 2022.

Early life
Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[6] Kohli's formative years were spent in the Uttam Nagar and commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[7] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a mere three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill, and request his father to bowl to him.[8]

In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WCDA) was created and on 30 May of that year, Prem Kohli, espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma, who initially perceived him to be just another enthusiastic and determined young boy. However, two weeks later, Sharma was impressed by Kohli's accuracy and power in throwing.[9] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in the gully cricket.[10] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, not due to a lack of merit but due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals, as he was determined that Kohli should earn his recognition based on his own merit and overcome the system of nepotism and deceit prevalent in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA). Kohli persisted and eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[11] He received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[12] As per Sharma's recollection of Kohli's initial days at his academy, he exuded remarkable talent, making it arduous for the coach to curb his enthusiasm. Kohli remained prepared to bat at any position, and often, Sharma had to physically coerce him to leave the training sessions, as he was reluctant to depart.[13] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[10] Kohli's ardent passion for cricket compelled him to travel long distances with his father to ensure that he never missed a match. With time, he diligently honed his skills and diversified his range of shots, commanding respect from the local bowlers.[14]

On the 18th of December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a cerebral attack.[10][15] During his childhood, his father played a crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his father as the one who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of missing his father's presence at times.[7][16] Following the demise of Kohli's father, his mother observed a significant change in his personality. Kohli appeared to become more mature overnight, and he began taking every cricket match seriously. He harboured an aversion to exclusion from games and appeared to channel his entire existence into the pursuit of cricket following his father's untimely demise.[10] Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.[17]

Youth and domestic career
Delhi
Kohli's junior cricket career kicked off in October 2002 at the Luhnu cricket ground in a Polly Umrigar match against the host state of Himachal Pradesh. In his debut match, Kohli managed to score a total of fifteen runs. His first half-century in national cricket came at Ferozeshah Kotla, where he scored 70 runs against Harayana.[18] By the end of the season, Kohli had amassed a total of 172 runs, emerging as the highest run-scorer for his side with an average of 34.40.[19] During the 2003–04 season, Kohli was appointed as the captain of the under-15 team. In his first match of the season, he scored 54 runs in Delhi's victory over Himachal Pradesh. In the next fixture against Jammu and Kashmir, Kohli scored his maiden century with a score of 119 in a BCCI-conducted game. By the end of the season, he had amassed a total of 390 runs at an average of 78, which included two centuries.[20][21][a] Towards the end of 2004, Kohli earned selection for the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy with the Delhi under-17 team. In the four matches that he played, Kohli accumulated a total of 470 runs, with his highest score being 251* runs. The team's coach, Ajit Chaudhary, lauded his performance and was particularly impressed with his temperament on the field.[22][23] In the 2005–06 season, Kohli commenced his innings with a score of 227 against Punjab. Following their victory over Uttar Pradesh in the quarter-finals, Delhi was scheduled to play against Baroda in the semi-finals. The team had high expectations from Kohli, who had promised his coach to finish the job. True to his word, Kohli went on to score 228 runs, leading Delhi to victory. The team later secured the tournament with a five-wicket win over Mumbai, where he contributed with a half-century in the first innings.[24] He ended as the highest run-scorer with a total of 757 runs from 7 matches, averaging 84.11.[25]

On the 18th of February, 2006, Kohli made his debut in List A cricket, playing against Services in the Ranji One-Day Trophy, but he did not have the opportunity to bat during the match.[26] In 2006, Kohli had garnered enough attention to earn a spot in the state senior team. Subsequently, he made his first-class debut on the 23rd of November, 2006, during the opening match of the Ranji Trophy season against Tamil Nadu. However, his debut innings was a brief one, as he was dismissed after scoring ten runs.[27] In a sequence of three matches, Kohli failed to score a fifty, leading his coaches to provide him with counselling. In the subsequent match against former champions, Karnataka, Delhi found themselves trailing with a score of 130/5, with Kohli remaining unbeaten on 40 at the end of the day's play. That very night, Kohli's father passed away at 3:54 a.m. Despite the heart-wrenching news, Kohli returned to the match and continued to bat and scored 90 runs before he was dismissed.[28] The team's coach, Chetan Chauhan was impressed by Kohli's resolute determination and unwavering attitude in the face of adversity. Venkatesh Prasad also lauded his crucial knock, which was executed in the midst of an emotional upheaval.[29] Following his dismissal, Kohli immediately attended his father's funeral. His innings, however, proved to be crucial for Delhi as they were able to avoid the follow-on. The team's captain, Mithun Manhas, praised Kohli for his performance, acknowledging its pivotal role in the team's success.[29]

Kohli's foray into T20 cricket took place in April 2007, during the Inter-State T20 Championship, where he emerged as the top run-getter for his team with a tally of 179 runs at an average of 35.80.[30] In September 2008, Kohli played in Nissar Trophy against SNGPL (reigning champions of the of Quaid-i-Azam Trophy from Pakistan). He emerged as the leading scorer for Delhi in both innings, registering 52 runs in the first innings and a towering 197 in the second. The match ultimately ended in a draw, SNGPL being declared the victors due to their lead in first innings.[31] In the 2009–10 Ranji Trophy season, Kohli returned to domestic cricket. During a match against Maharastra, he opened the batting and scored 67 runs, helping Delhi to secure the bonus point required for victory.[32] Kohli's performance reinvigorated the competitive spirit of the domestic cricket circuit. Ashish Nehra observed his growth over time and shared his thoughts:[33]

I did not see him waste his time. If not on the field, he would be busy in the gym. I saw him first as a chubby-cheeked bubbly young kid who grew into a perfect athlete. His junior cricket lessons have obviously helped him. I did not now him well, but had heard a lot about his exploits in junior cricket.

India Under-19
In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s,[34] while also averaging 49 in the three-match Test series.[35] Following India Under-19's success in both the ODI and Test series, the team's coach Lalchand Rajput noted Kohli's adeptness in facing both pace and spin bowling and expressed his admiration for profound technical prowess.[36] In September, the India Under-19 team toured Pakistan. In the first Test match, Kohli scored 63 and 28 as India won by 271 runs against Pakistan Under-19s. In the second match, he contributed 83 runs to India's victory by 240 runs and an innings. He concluded the tour with 80 runs in the final ODI game at Lahore.[37] In early 2007, Kohli was a part of the India Under-19 team that toured New Zealand, where he scored 113 in the first Test match. The series ended in a draw with a 1–1 score line. In the following month, the team travelled to Malaysia for a tri-series against England Under-19s and Sri Lanka Under-19s, where Kohli did not get many opportunities to bat. In July–August, India Under-19 embarked on a tour for a tri-series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, where he did not score a half-century in any of the matches. However, he made a comeback with scores of 144 and an unbeaten 94 in the following Test series.[38]

In February–March 2008, Kohli assumed the captaincy of the Indian squad that went on to triumph at the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia. He demonstrated his competence as a batsman, amassing 235 runs in 6 games at an average of 47, ranking as the tournament's third-highest scorer and one of three cricketers to compile a century.[39] His century, a knock of 100 runs off 74 balls, versus the West Indies Under-19s in a group stage encounter, was lauded by ESPNcricinfo, as "the innings of the tournament." This innings paved the way for India's 50-run triumph and fetched Kohli the man of the match award.[40] Additionally, Kohli's all-round performance in the semi-final against New Zealand Under-19s, where he captured 2 wickets and contributed 43 runs in the run-chase, was significant to India's 3-wicket victory.[41] In the championship match, Kohli managed a modest score of 19 against South Africa Under-19s, his contribution lead to India's eventual 12-run win (via D/L method).[42]

In June of the year 2008, Kohli and his Under-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border-Gavaskar scholarship. This scholarship, aimed at honing the skills of the chosen cricketers, provided an opportunity to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.[43] In a bid to identify potential talent for the senior team, Kohli was selected to represent India Emerging Players in the Emerging Players Tournament of 2008. Notably, his finest performance in the tournament was against New Zealand Emerging Players, where he played a knock of 120 runs, leading India to a seven-wicket victory. With an aggregate of 204 runs, Kohli's performances did not go unnoticed by the national selectors who were observing his progress. With twenty-eight under-19 ODIs and twelve under-19 Tests, he embarked on his journey to international cricket by joining the senior team on their flight to Colombo.[44]

International career
2008–2009: Debut and maiden stint
In August 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only eight List A matches under his belt.[45] So, his selection was considered a "surprise call-up".[46] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the series.[47] On 18 August 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara.[48] However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli achieved his inaugural half century in the ODl format, with a total of fifty-four runs scored.[49]

Following the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008.[50] Despite limited opportunities, he managed to make an impact in the single innings that he participated in, scoring 49 runs.[51] In October 2008, Kohli participated in a four-day tour match against Australia as part of the Indian Board President's XI team. The match featured a formidable Australian bowling line-up that consisted of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza. Despite this, Kohli displayed his batting prowess by scoring 105 runs in the first innings and an unbeaten 16 runs in the second innings, demonstrating his ability to perform against high-level international competition.[52]

In November 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the squad for the home ODI series against England, due to the presence of established and experienced players such as Tendulkar and Sehwag, he was not given an opportunity to play in any of the matches.[53] In December 2008, Kohli was awarded a Grade D contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as part of the annual contract list for the Indian national team which entitled him to receive ₹1.5 million (equivalent to ₹4.2 million or US$52,000 in 2023), A certain level of remuneration for representing the national team in various matches and events.[54] Despite being awarded a contract, in January, Kohli was dropped for the five-match ODl series against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.[55]

In July–August 2009, Kohli was selected in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament, held in Australia. He was selected to open the innings for the Indian Emerging Players team in the tournament, and he went on to have a standout performance. Kohli finished as the tournament's leading run-scorer, with a total of 398 runs from seven matches, at an average of 66.33. He was particularly impressive in the final match, where he scored 104 runs off 102 balls against the South Africa Emerging Players team in Brisbane. His strong performance helped lead his team to a 17-run victory and the tournament title.[56][57] At the conclusion of the tournament, Kris Srikkanth, the Chairman of the Indian national selection committee, expressed his admiration for Kohli's performance during the tournament. Srikkanth stated, "I must say, opener Virat Kohli was outstanding. Some of the shots he played spoke about his ability."[58] Kohli himself has stated that this tournament was a "turning point" in his career.[59]

In August 2009, Kohli returned to the national team after recovering from a minor shoulder injury, replacing the injured Gautam Gambhir in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.[60] He was also utilized as a middle order batsman in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy due to an injury sustained by Yuvraj Singh.[61] In December of that same year, he was included in the team for home ODI series against Sri Lanka and scored 27[62] and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj, who regained fitness for the third ODI. However, due to the reoccurrence of a finger injury, Yuvraj was ruled out indefinitely,[63] which led to Kohli's return to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata. In that match, Kohli scored his maiden ODI century–107 off 114 balls–while sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir. As a result of this performance, India won by seven wickets and sealed the series 3–1.[64][b]

2010–2011: Rise through the ranks
In January 2010, Kohli was given the opportunity in tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh, as Tendulkar was rested for the event.[65] During the series, Kohli became just the third Indian player to score two ODI centuries before the age of 22.[66] He was widely hailed for his performances, and ultimately emerged as the leading run-scorer of the series, with 275 runs from five innings at an impressive average of 91.66.[67] Kohli's success on the field belies the stereotype of him as a brash and arrogant player. In fact, Indian captain MS Dhoni has noted that "he has grabbed his chances" and that "he has matured now." Dhoni went on to say that "To us, he comes as a 'humble guy'. He might come across different to the world."[68]

Kohli's initial foray into leadership on an international level occurred in May–June 2010, when he was appointed as vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe. This appointment came as many more established players were rested for the tour. However, in the first match, Kohli was dismissed on a diamond duck, a rare and unusual mode of dismissal.[69] Despite this early setback, Kohli managed to become the fastest Indian batsman at the time to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket, achieving this milestone in 26 innings.[70] Kohli also made his International T20 debut against Zimbabwe at Harare, where he scored an unbeaten 26.[71] Later that month, during the 2010 Asia Cup, Kohli was included in the Indian team and was given the role of batting at number 3. However, his struggles with form started as he scored a total of 67 runs at an average of 16.75.[72] This poor form was also reflected in the tri-series against Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka where his average was a mere 15.[73]

Despite his recent struggles with form, Kohli was retained in the Indian ODI squad for a three-match series against Australia in October. In the only completed match of the series, held at Visakhapatnam, Kohli scored a century, earning him the man of the match award. He candidly acknowledged that he was under significant pressure to maintain his place in the team, given his previous failures in the preceding series.[74] During the home ODI series against New Zealand, Kohli scored another match-winning century in the first match, marking his fourth ODI hundred and second in succession.[75] The Indian team emerged victorious with a 5–0 whitewash over New Zealand, and Kohli's exceptional performances in the series solidified his position in the ODI team and made him a strong candidate for a spot in India's World Cup squad.[76][77] He was India's leading run-scorer in ODIs in 2010, accumulating 995 runs from 25 matches at an average of 47.38, including three centuries and seven half-centuries.[78]

"He is a very physical type of player. He likes to impose himself on the game, backs it up with his skill."

Kohli was India's leading run scorer in the five-match ODI series of the South African tour in January 2011, with 193 runs including two fifties, both in Indian defeats.[80] During the series, he jumped to number two spot on the ICC Rankings for Men's ODI batters,[81] and was named in India's 15-man squad for the World Cup.[82]

Kohli played in every match of India's successful World Cup campaign. He scored an unbeaten 100 in the first match against Bangladesh and became the first Indian batsman to score a century on World Cup debut.[83] In the final against Sri Lanka at Mumbai, he scored 35, sharing an 83 runs partnership with Gambhir for the third wicket after India had lost both openers within seven overs while chasing 275.[84][85]

Breakthrough in Test cricket
When India toured the West Indies in June–July 2011, they selected a largely inexperienced squad, resting Tendulkar while others such as Gambhir and Sehwag missed out due to injuries. Kohli was one of three uncapped players in the Test squad.[86] Kohli made his Test debut at Kingston in the first match of the Test series that followed. He batted at 5th position and was dismissed on scores of 4 and 15, caught behind off the bowling of Fidel Edwards in both innings.[87] India went on to win the Test series 1–0 but Kohli amassed just 76 runs from five innings,[88] struggling against the short ball.[89]

Initially got dropped from the Test squad for India's four-match series in England in July and August due to poor performance in his debut series. However Kohli was recalled as a replacement for the injured Yuvraj,[90] though he did not get to play in any match of that series. He found moderate success in the subsequent ODI series in which he averaged 38.80.[91] His score of 55 in the first ODI at Chester-le-Street was followed by a string of low scores in the next three matches.[49] In the last game of the series at Cardiff, Kohli scored his sixth ODI hundred–107 runs off 93 balls–and shared 170 runs partnership with Rahul Dravid for the third wicket,[92] who was playing his last ODI match.[93] Kohli was dismissed hit wicket in that innings .It was the only century in the series by any player of either team and earned him praise for his "hard work" and "maturity".[94]

In October 2011, Kohli was the leading run scorer of the five-match home ODI series against England which India won 5–0. He scored a total of 270 runs across five matches at an average of 90. This included unbeaten knock of 112 from 98 balls at Delhi, where he put on an unbroken 209 run partnership with Gambhir;[95] followed by innings of 86 at Mumbai, both the knocks came in successful run chases.[96] Owing to his ODI success, Kohli was included in the Test squad to face the West Indies in November. He was selected in the final match of the series at Mumbai in which he scored a pair of fifties.[97] India won the subsequent ODI series 4–1 in which Kohli managed to accumulate 243 runs at 60.75.[98] During the series, Kohli scored his eighth ODI century and his second at Visakhapatnam, where he made 117 off 123 balls in India's run chase of 270.[99] A knock which raised his reputation as "an expert of the chase".[100] Kohli ended up as the leading run-getter in ODIs for the year 2011, with 1381 runs from 34 matches at 47.62 including four centuries and eight fifties.[101]

During tour of Australia in December 2011, Kohli failed to go past 25 in the first two Tests, as his defensive technique was exposed.[102] While fielding on the boundary during the second day of the second match at Sydney, he gestured to the crowd with his middle finger for which he was fined 50% of his match fee by the match referee.[103] He top scored in each of India's innings in the third Test at Perth with scores of 44 and 75, even as India got their second consecutive innings defeat.[104][105] In the fourth and final match at Adelaide, Kohli scored his maiden Test century, 116 runs in the first innings.[106] India suffered a 0–4 whitewash and Kohli, India's top run-scorer in the series was described as "the lone bright spot in an otherwise nightmare visit for the tourists".[107]

2012–2013: ODI ascendancy and ascension to vice-captaincy
In the first seven matches of the Commonwealth Bank triangular series that India played against hosts Australia and Sri Lanka, Kohli made two fifties–77 at Perth and 66 at Brisbane, both against Sri Lanka.[49] Being set a target of 321 by Sri Lanka, Kohli came to the crease with India's score at 86/2 and went on to score 133 not out from 86 balls to take India to a comfortable win with 13 overs to spare.[108] India earned a bonus point with the win and Kohli was named Man of the Match for his knock.[109] Former Australian cricketer and commentator Dean Jones rated Kohli's innings as "one of the greatest ODI knocks of all time".[110] However, Sri Lanka beat Australia three days later in their last group fixture and knocked India out of the series.[111] With 373 runs at 53.28, Kohli finished as India's highest run-scorer and lone centurion of the series.[112]


Kohli fielding during a CB Series match against Australia in February 2012
Kohli was appointed the vice-captain for the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh on the back of his fine performances in Australia. Kohli was in fine form during the tournament, finishing as the leading run-scorer with 357 runs at an average of 119.[113] In the final group stage match against Pakistan, he scored his personal best of 183 from 148 balls, his 11th ODI century. He helped India to chase down 330, their highest successful ODI run chase at the time.[114] His knock was the highest individual score in Asia Cup history surpassing previous record of 144 by Younis Khan in 2004 and the joint second highest score along with Dhoni in an ODI run-chase; also became the highest individual score against Pakistan in ODIs.[115] Kohli was awarded the man of the match in both the matches that India won,[116][117] nonetheless India could not progress to the final of the tournament.[118]

In July–August 2012, Kohli struck two centuries in the five-match ODI tour of Sri Lanka ,106 off 113 balls at Hambantota and 128* off 119 balls at Colombo, winning man of the match in both games.[119][120] India won the series 4–1 and Kohli was named player of the series.[121] In the one-off T20I that followed, he scored a 48 ball 68, his first T20I fifty, and yet again won the player of the series award.[122] He continued to be in good form during the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, with 185 runs he was highest run-getter among Indian batsmen;[123] hitting two fifties during the tournament, against Afghanistan and Pakistan, winning man of the match for both his innings.[124][125] For his performances he was named in the ICC 'Team of the Tournament'.[126]

Kohli's Test form dipped during the first three matches of England's tour of India, between October 2012 and January 2013, with a top score of 20 and England leading the series 2–1.[87] Overcoming his poor run of form, he scored a patient 103 from 295 balls in the last match.[127] However, the match ended in a draw and England won their first Test series in India in 28 years.[128] Against Pakistan in December 2012, Kohli averaged 18 in the T20Is[129] and 4.33 in the ODIs.[130] Troubled by the fast bowlers, particularly Junaid Khan who dismissed him on all three occasions in the ODI series.[131] Kohli had a quiet ODI series against England, apart from a match-winning 77* in the third ODI[132] with a total of 155 runs at an average of 38.75.[133] Kohli scored his fourth Test century (107) at Chennai in the first match of the home Test series against Australia in February 2013.[87] India completed a 4–0 series sweep, becoming the first team to whitewash Australia in more than four decades.[134] Kohli averaged 56.80 in the series .[135]

"I love watching Virat Kohli bat. He looks to me like an individual of my own heart. I love his aggression, and he has serious passion that I used to have. He reminds me of myself."

 – Former West Indies captain Viv Richards on Kohli., [136]
In June 2013, Kohli featured in the ICC Champions Trophy in England which India won.

— Kohli after scoring 71st century, [298]
He carried his good form into the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. In the first game against Pakistan, Kohli scored 82* and won the match for his team by a close margin.

In 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) introduced the Indian Premier League (IPL), a franchise-based Twenty20 league. Among the franchises, Royal Challengers Bangalore, owned by Vijay Mallya at the time, selected Kohli to join their team for a sum of $30,000 through a draft. This decision was influenced by Kohli's performance in the Under-19 World Cup held in Malaysia.[310]

2008–2009: Early seasons
In the inaugural match of the IPL, Kohli played in a high-stakes encounter against the Kolkata Knight Riders, where he fell early to an dismissal, contributing a single run to the team's pursuit of a target of 223 runs.[311] As the tournament progressed, Kohli found himself occupying a position in the middle order, but his impact in this role was relatively limited, prompting a strategic decision to reinstate him at the top order during the match against the Deccan Charges. It was in this role that he rediscovered his form and made contributions to his team's cause.[312] However, in the last two games of the tournament, Kohli had to sacrifice his preferred position in order to accommodate Misbah-ul-Haq, taking on the responsibility of batting in the middle order once again.[313] Concluding the season, Kohli's individual performance yielded a total of 165 runs, as Bangalore secured the seventh position on the points table.[314]

In the subsequent season, Kohli encountered a series of low scores in the initial two matches before bouncing back with a half-century in the third match against Deccan Chargers, in team's defeat.[315] Throughout the remainder of the season, Kohli displayed moderate performances or found limited opportunities to bat, owing to the dominance of top-order batsmen Jacques Kallis and Ross Taylor. This proved advantageous for the team, as they secured a spot in the playoffs.[316] In the semi-final against Chennai Super Kings, Kohli made crucial contributions to the team's successful chase, propelling Bangalore to the final.[317] In final against Deccan Charges, Kohli got stumped for 7 as Bangalore fell short by a margin of 8 runs, thus concluding the season as runners-up.[318]

<p>At the outset of the 2015 season of the IPL, Kohli expressed his optimism about playing with reduced pressure, attributing it to the strengthened middle order of the Bangalore team.[367] Kohli strategically decided to open the batting alongside Gayle for the season. In the second match against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, he scored 41 runs, providing a moderate start to his campaign.[368] Continuing his form, Kohli achieved his first half-century of the season, albeit in a match that ended in defeat against the Chennai Super Kings.[369] In the subsequent match, Kohli again notched a fifty, leading Bangalore to victory and ending their three-match losing streak.[370] During this match, he exhibited his tactical acumen by promoting AB de Villiers up the batting order, recognizing the importance of having the team's premier batsman face more deliveries.[371] Bangalore, looking to overcome their previous struggles in the bowling department, successfully bowled out the Delhi Daredevils for 95 runs, while Kohli guided his team to a ten-wicket victory during the chase.[372] However, in an away game against Chennai, Kohli fell short of reaching a half-century, scoring 48 runs before being run out by Dwayne Bravo due to a momentary lapse in judgment. Bangalore's loss in that match marked the end of their winning streak.[373] His standout innings of the season came against the Mumbai Indians, where he played a knock of 82 runs, forming a record-breaking 215-run partnership with de Villiers.[374] In a rain-affected match against the Hyderabad, with a target of 83 runs to chase in six overs, Kohli scored quickfire 44 off 19 balls, earning him player of the match award.[375] In the subsequent game, Kohli found himself entangled in an incident involving an anti-corruption code breach. Nonetheless, he managed to continue playing due to breach's absence of severity.[376] Qualifying for the playoffs for the first time under his captaincy, Kohli held firm confidence in the turnaround his team had showcased during the later stages of the league.[377] However, in the qualifier 2 against Chennai, Kohli's dismissal for 12 runs proved detrimental to Bangalore's chances, resulting in their defeat and the conclusion of their campaign for the season. Throughout the season, Kohli accumulated a total of 505 runs in 16 matches with an average of 45.90, then third-highest run tally achieved by him in a single season.[378]

Although the match ended in defeat for his team, Kohli's knock earned him the player of the match.[381] Despite Kohli's performances, Bangalore struggled in the league stage, securing only two victories out of their seven matches and finding themselves in the seventh position on the points table.[382] To revive their chances of qualifying for the playoffs, Bangalore needed to win six out of their next seven matches. In the subsequent match, Kohli scored a century in a successful chase against Rising Pune Supergiant as Bangalore's virtual knockouts began.[383] He continued to deliver match-winning performances, forming a record-breaking partnership of 229 runs with de Villiers against the Gujarat,[384] followed by playing a knock of 75* against the Kolkata Knight Riders.[385] In a rain-affected match against the Kings XI Punjab, Kohli achieved his fourth century of the season, surpassing the milestone of 4,000 runs in the</p>

<p>In August 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only eight List A matches under his belt.[45] So, his selection was considered a "surprise call-up".[46] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the series.[47] On 18 August 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara.[48] However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli achieved his inaugural half century in the ODl format, with a total of fifty-four runs scored.[49]

Following the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008.[50] Despite limited opportunities, he managed to make an impact in the single innings that he participated in, scoring 49 runs.[51] In October 2008, Kohli participated in a four-day tour match against Australia as part of the Indian Board President's XI team. The match featured a formidable Australian bowling line-up that consisted of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza. Despite this, Kohli displayed his batting prowess by scoring 105 runs in the first innings and an unbeaten 16 runs in the second innings, demonstrating his ability to perform against high-level international competition.[52]

In November 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the squad for the home ODI series against England, due to the presence of established and experienced players such as Tendulkar and Sehwag, he was not given an opportunity to play in any of the matches.[53] In December 2008, Kohli was awarded a Grade D contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as part of the annual contract list for the Indian national team which entitled him to receive ₹1.5 million (equivalent to ₹4.2 million or US$52,000 in 2023), A certain level of remuneration for representing the national team in various matches and events.[54] Despite being awarded a contract, in January, Kohli was dropped for the five-match ODl series against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.[55]

In July–August 2009, Kohli was selected in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament, held in Australia. He was selected to open the innings for the Indian Emerging Players team in the tournament, and he went on to have a standout performance. Kohli finished as the tournament's leading run-scorer, with a total of 398 runs from seven matches, at an average of 66.33. He was particularly impressive in the final match, where he scored 104 runs off 102 balls against the South Africa Emerging Players team in Brisbane. His strong performance helped lead his team to a 17-run victory and the tournament title.[56][57] At the conclusion of the tournament, Kris Srikkanth, the Chairman of the Indian national selection committee, expressed his admiration for Kohli's performance during the tournament. Srikkanth stated, "I must say, opener Virat Kohli was outstanding. Some of the shots he played spoke about his ability."[58] Kohli himself has stated that this tournament was a "turning point" in his career.[59]

In August 2009, Kohli returned to the national team after recovering from a minor shoulder injury, replacing the injured Gautam Gambhir in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.[60] He was also utilized as a middle order batsman in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy due to an injury sustained by Yuvraj Singh.[61] In December of that same year, he was included in the team for home ODI series against Sri Lanka and scored 27[62] and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj, who regained fitness for the third ODI. However, due to the reoccurrence of a finger injury, Yuvraj was ruled out indefinitely,[63] which led to Kohli's return to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata. In that match, Kohli scored his maiden ODI century–107 off 114 balls–while sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir. As a result of this performance, India won by seven wickets and sealed the series 3–1.[64][b]

2010–2011: Rise through the ranks
In January 2010, Kohli was given the opportunity in tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh, as Tendulkar was rested for the event.[65] During the series, Kohli became just the third Indian player to score two ODI centuries before the age of 22.[66] He was widely hailed for his performances, and ultimately emerged as the leading run-scorer of the series, with 275 runs from five innings at an impressive average of 91.66.[67] Kohli's success on the field belies the stereotype of him as a brash and arrogant player. In fact, Indian captain MS Dhoni has noted that "he has grabbed his chances" and that "he has matured now." Dhoni went on to say that "To us, he comes as a 'humble guy'. He might come across different to the world."[68]

Kohli's initial foray into leadership on an international level occurred in May–June 2010, when he was appointed as vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe. This appointment came as many more established players were rested for the tour. However, in the first match, Kohli was dismissed on a diamond duck, a rare and unusual mode of dismissal.[69] Despite this early setback, Kohli managed to become the fastest Indian batsman at the time to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket, achieving this milestone in 26 innings.[70] Kohli also made his International T20 debut against Zimbabwe at Harare, where he scored an unbeaten 26.[71] Later that month, during the 2010 Asia Cup, Kohli was included in the Indian team and was given the role of batting at number 3. However, his struggles with form started as he scored a total of 67 runs at an average of 16.75.[72] This poor form was also reflected in the tri-series against Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka where his average was a mere 15.[73]

Despite his recent struggles with form, Kohli was retained in the Indian ODI squad for a three-match series against Australia in October. In the only completed match of the series, held at Visakhapatnam, Kohli scored a century, earning him the man of the match award. He candidly acknowledged that he was under significant pressure to maintain his place in the team, given his previous failures in the preceding series.[74] During the home ODI series against New Zealand, Kohli scored another match-winning century in the first match, marking his fourth ODI hundred and second in succession.[75] The Indian team emerged victorious with a 5–0 whitewash over New Zealand, and Kohli's exceptional performances in the series solidified his position in the ODI team and made him a strong candidate for a spot in India's World Cup squad.[76][77] He was India's leading run-scorer in ODIs in 2010, accumulating 995 runs from 25 matches at an average of 47.38, including three centuries and seven half-centuries.[78]

"He is a very physical type of player. He likes to impose himself on the game, backs it up with his skill."

Kohli was India's leading run scorer in the five-match ODI series of the South African tour in January 2011, with 193 runs including two fifties, both in Indian defeats.[80] During the series, he jumped to number two spot on the ICC Rankings for Men's ODI batters,[81] and was named in India's 15-man squad for the World Cup.[82]

Kohli played in every match of India's successful World Cup campaign. He scored an unbeaten 100 in the first match against Bangladesh and became the first Indian batsman to score a century on World Cup debut.[83] In the final against Sri Lanka at Mumbai, he scored 35, sharing an 83 runs partnership with Gambhir for the third wicket after India had lost both openers within seven overs while chasing 275.[84][85]


Kohli fielding during a match in December 2010
Breakthrough in Test cricket
When India toured the West Indies in June–July 2011, they selected a largely inexperienced squad, resting Tendulkar while others such as Gambhir and Sehwag missed out due to injuries. Kohli was one of three uncapped players in the Test squad.[86] Kohli made his Test debut at Kingston in the first match of the Test series that followed. He batted at 5th position and was dismissed on scores of 4 and 15, caught behind off the bowling of Fidel Edwards in both innings.[87] India went on to win the Test series 1–0 but Kohli amassed just 76 runs from five innings,[88] struggling against the short ball.[89]

However Kohli was recalled as a replacement for the injured Yuvraj,[90] though he did not get to play in any match of that series. He found moderate success in the subsequent ODI series in which he averaged 38.80.[91] His score of 55 in the first ODI at Chester-le-Street was followed by a string of low scores in the next three matches.[49] In the last game of the series at Cardiff, Kohli scored his sixth ODI hundred–107 runs off 93 balls–and shared 170 runs partnership with Rahul Dravid for the third wicket,[92] who was playing his last ODI match.[93] Kohli was dismissed hit wicket in that innings .It was the only century in the series by any player of either team and earned him praise for his "hard work" and "maturity".[94]

In October 2011, Kohli was the leading run scorer of the five-match home ODI series against England which India won 5–0. He scored a total of 270 runs across five matches at an average of 90. This included unbeaten knock of 112 from 98 balls at Delhi, where he put on an unbroken 209 run partnership with Gambhir;[95] followed by innings of 86 at Mumbai, both the knocks came in successful run chases.[96] Owing to his ODI success, Kohli was included in the Test squad to face the West Indies in November. He was selected in the final match of the series at Mumbai in which he scored a pair of fifties.[97] India won the subsequent ODI series 4–1 in which Kohli managed to accumulate 243 runs at 60.75.[98] During the series, Kohli scored his eighth ODI century and his second at Visakhapatnam, where he made 117 off 123 balls in India's run chase of 270.[99] A knock which raised his reputation as "an expert of the chase".[100] Kohli ended up as the leading run-getter in ODIs for the year 2011, with 1381 runs from 34 matches at 47.62 including four centuries and eight fifties.[101]

During tour of Australia in December 2011, Kohli failed to go past 25 in the first two Tests, as his defensive technique was exposed.[102] While fielding on the boundary during the second day of the second match at Sydney, he gestured to the crowd with his middle finger for which he was fined 50% of his match fee by the match referee.[103] He top scored in each of India's innings in the third Test at Perth with scores of 44 and 75, even as India got their second consecutive innings defeat.[104][105] In the fourth and final match at Adelaide, Kohli scored his maiden Test century, 116 runs in the first innings.[106] India suffered a 0–4 whitewash and Kohli, India's top run-scorer in the series was described as "the lone bright spot in an otherwise nightmare visit for the tourists".[107]</p>
